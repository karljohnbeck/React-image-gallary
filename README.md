# Project Name: Gallery of my life

## Description

_Duration: 1 weekend_

This project was to create a gallery of images from my life using React. I created a main App.js that would render the html page and brought in other components to keep App.js from becoming too cluttered with code. A user would be able to add photos with descriptions to the site using the provided input fields. thr user would also be able to "like" different photos on the page by clicking a like. below the total number of likes would be displayed on the page. If a image needs to be deleted, a delete button is below each photo that will remove the image from the database. 

## Screen Shot

![sample image]('sample.jpg')

## Usage


1. Create a database using the command lines in the database.sql file (I used postico to talk with PostgreSQL).
2. Turn on the server with 'npm run server' in the terminal.
3. In a new terminal window, turn on the client with 'npm run client'.
4. Go to localhost:3000 in your browser.
5. View the gallery of images, if you click on an image it will swap to a description of the picture, clicking again will swap back.
6. If you want to like a image, click the like this button.
7. If you want ot delete an image, click the delete button below the image. 
8. To add an image, add a url to the image and type in a description.
